Dining philosopher’s: Resource sharing between five machines in a distributed environment using the dining philosopher’s algorithm.
•	Running the server and the client in the same machine using Multi-threading programming and sockets.

•	Using Mutex locks for the acquiring of the fork/resource between sever or client in the same program.

We have to run the program in each machine passing the number of that machine(ie 1-5) as an argument.
